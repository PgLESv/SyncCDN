# SyncCDN 🚀

**SyncCDN** is a lightweight, open-source utility designed to synchronize content across multiple CDN endpoints efficiently. It automates the process of hashing and updating files, ensuring your CDN is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
(I don't know what i am doing)

## Features ✨
- **File Hashing:** Manually generate hashes for your files to detect changes with the python script in your server.
- **PowerShell Integration:** Leverage the power of PowerShell for seamless automation.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on any platform supporting PowerShell.

## Getting Started 🛠️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PgLESv/SyncCDN.git
   ```
2. Run the synchronization script:
   ```bash
   ./Sync.ps1
   ```
Note: 
- You must already have a CDN server configured, with permissions and the Python script on the server. It is possible to configure it to automate hash generation.
- Server > client only
